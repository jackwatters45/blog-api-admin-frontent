# blog-admin-frontend

## Notes

- for this project - avoid using libraries
- user frontend -> use libraries when needed
- i think form error is unused

- Need to check if user is admin

  - admin can create other admin
    - create user form that is the same as signup but includes a user type and is only accessible to admin
    - gonna need to figure out how to add different levels of security

- make sure default router set up good
- eventually remove signup -> adjust so that this is admin and other one is both viewing and editing
- actually plan out the components
  - figma?
- secured endpoint test out

## Needs

- Admin View
